### Local Installation

If you don't want to use the Chrome Web Store, you can install the extension locally:

1. Prepare Your Extension Files: Make sure your extension's files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are properly organized in one directory. This includes the manifest.json file, which is necessary for the extension to work.

2. Open the Extension Management page: You can do this by clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of Chrome to open the menu, then go to More Tools > Extensions. Alternatively, you can type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar and hit enter.

3. Enable Developer Mode: On the Extensions page, at the top right corner, you will see a switch for Developer mode. Turn it on. This will enable more options for you.

4. Load Unpacked Extension: Once Developer mode is enabled, you'll see a few more buttons at the top left of the page. Click on the "Load unpacked" button.

5. Select Your Extension's Directory: A file dialog will open. Navigate to the directory where your extension files are, and click "Select." Make sure you select the directory itself, not an individual file.

After performing these steps, your extension should now be loaded and active in Chrome. You can see it listed at the top of the Extensions page, and depending on your extension's settings, it may also show up next to the address bar or in the Chrome menu.
